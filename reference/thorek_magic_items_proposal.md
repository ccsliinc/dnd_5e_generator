# Magic Item Proposals for Thorek Bearward
## Level 3 Hill Dwarf Beast Master Ranger

---

### Item 1: Bracers of Archery
**Rarity:** Uncommon  
**Source:** Dungeon Master's Guide (Official)  
**Attunement:** Yes

**Description:**  
These silver-inlaid leather bracers are etched with elven script depicting famous archers of legend.

**Properties:**
- +2 bonus to damage rolls made with longbows and shortbows
- Grants proficiency with longbow and shortbow (if not already proficient)

**Why This Fits Thorek:**  
As an archer-focused ranger, this provides a straightforward damage boost to his primary combat style. The +2 damage stacks nicely with Hunter's Mark for consistent ranged DPS.

### Item 2: Cloak of the Bear Spirit
**Rarity:** Uncommon  
**Source:** Custom Item  
**Attunement:** Yes (by a ranger with a bear companion)

**Description:**  
This heavy cloak is made from thick bear fur with carved bone clasps. When worn, the wearer occasionally catches the faint scent of honey and mountain pine. The cloak grows warm when bears are near.

**Properties:**
- You can speak with bears as if under the effect of *Speak with Animals*
- You have advantage on all Charisma checks when interacting with bears
- Once per long rest, you can cast *Enhance Ability* (Bear's Endurance only) on yourself or your animal companion without expending a spell slot
- While your bear companion is within 30 feet of you, it gains +1 to its AC

**Why This Fits Thorek:**  
Deeply thematic for a dwarf with a bear companion. Provides survivability through temporary HP and makes Ironjaw harder to hit. The speak with bears ability could create interesting roleplay opportunities.

### Item 3: Quiver of Ehlonna
**Rarity:** Uncommon  
**Source:** Dungeon Master's Guide (Official)  
**Attunement:** No

**Description:**  
This finely crafted leather quiver appears completely ordinary, decorated with simple leaf patterns along its rim.

**Properties:**
- Weighs the same whether empty or full (2 lbs)
- Can hold up to:
  - 60 arrows
  - 18 javelins or similar sized objects
  - 6 staves, bows, or quarterstaffs
- Items stored don't contribute to carrying capacity
- Draw any item stored as if from a regular quiver (free interaction)

**Why This Fits Thorek:**  
Solves ammunition management and allows carrying backup weapons without weight concerns. Particularly useful for a strength-based ranger who might want to carry multiple weapons but has lower carrying capacity than typical STR builds due to not maxing strength.

### Item 4: Ring of the Wild Hunt
**Rarity:** Rare  
**Source:** Custom Item  
**Attunement:** Yes (by a Beast Master ranger)

**Description:**  
This iron ring is carved to resemble intertwining vines and small animal tracks. When worn by a Beast Master, their animal companion's eyes occasionally gleam with a faint green light, and their movements become more fluid and predatory.

**Properties:**  
While wearing this ring, your animal companion gains:
- +2 bonus to all damage rolls
- Maximum hit points increase by twice your ranger level (currently +6 HP at level 3)
- Advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened
- Its natural weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance

**Why This Fits Thorek:**  
The biggest weakness of the 2014 Beast Master is companion survivability and damage scaling. This ring directly addresses both issues, making Ironjaw a more viable combat threat throughout the campaign. The HP boost (taking Ironjaw from 19 to 25 HP) is especially crucial at lower levels.

## DM Notes

**Character Context:**  
Thorek is built as a tanky archer ranger with 34 HP and 15 AC, using Ironjaw the black bear as a front-line companion while he provides ranged support. The character uses the 2014 PHB Beast Master rules.

**Recommendation Priority:**
1. **If allowing one Rare item:** Ring of the Wild Hunt would have the biggest mechanical impact
2. **If preferring Uncommon:** Cloak of the Bear Spirit for theme + utility, or Bracers of Archery for simple effectiveness
3. **If wanting official items only:** Bracers of Archery or Quiver of Ehlonna

**Balance Considerations:**
- The custom items are designed to address known 2014 Beast Master weaknesses without overshadowing other party members
- Both custom items have built-in thematic restrictions (requiring specific companion type or class)
- None of these items significantly affect action economy or provide game-breaking abilities
