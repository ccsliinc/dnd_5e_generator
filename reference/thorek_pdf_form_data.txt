#### CHARACTER BACKSTORY
Thorek was a simple woodsman living on the edge of the great forest, making his living as a carpenter and guide. One fateful autumn, an orc warband descended upon his village. During the attack, he found a wounded bear cub whose mother had been slain by the orcs. Together, they fought off the raiders - Thorek with his grandfather's warhammer, and the young bear with surprising ferocity.

The village elder proclaimed them both heroes, and from that day forward, Thorek and the bear - whom he named Ironjaw for his powerful bite - became inseparable companions. Now they travel the land as defenders of the common folk, using Thorek's knowledge of the wilderness and Ironjaw's strength to protect those who cannot protect themselves.

Thorek learned to use a bow from the elven traders who passed through his village, combining their archery techniques with dwarven discipline. Though unusual for a dwarf to be a ranger, his connection to Ironjaw and dedication to protecting the innocent has earned him respect.
