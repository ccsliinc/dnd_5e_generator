## VISUAL DESCRIPTION BOX
*This ancient iron ring bears intricate carvings of intertwining vines punctuated by tiny animal tracks - wolf paws, bear claws, eagle talons, and deer hooves that seem to circle endlessly around the band. When worn by a Beast Master, the etchings emit a faint green luminescence, and the ranger's animal companion's eyes occasionally gleam with the same emerald light. The ring feels warm to the touch when beasts are near, and observers swear the carved vines slowly shift when viewed from the corner of one's eye.*

## LORE & HISTORY

### Origin Story
*"Forged in the First Age by the Archdruid Kelthanas Ironbark, these rings were created to honor the rangers who stood beside their animal companions during the War of Thorns. Only seven were made, each quenched in the Moonwell of Eternal Spring and blessed by the Great Bear Spirit. This ring was thought lost when Ranger-Captain Thorne Grimbear fell defending Silverwood Pass - until you recovered it."*

### Legendary Tales
• **The Battle of Frozen Peaks:** Ranger Alara's wolf companion, empowered by the ring, held off an entire orc warband
• **The Siege of Ironhold:** The ring's magic allowed a bear to break through magical wards
• **The Hunt of the Shadow Stag:** Enhanced senses let a hawk track an invisible fey creature

---

## IDENTIFICATION & AUTHENTICATION

### Identifying Marks
• Druidic runes spelling "WILD-HEART" in ancient script on inner band
• Maker's mark: Tiny oak leaf near the size adjustment
• Serial glyph: Three claw marks (3rd of 7 rings made)

### Detection Properties
• **Detect Magic:** Strong transmutation aura with hints of divination
• **Identify Spell:** Reveals all properties and the name "Kelthanas" 
• **Legend Lore:** Uncovers the full history and previous wielders

---

## CURSE/QUIRK (Optional DM Addition)

### Minor Quirk
*While wearing this ring, you occasionally experience brief flashes of your companion's instincts - sudden urges to sniff the air, mark territory, or chase small animals. These are fleeting and harmless but can be embarrassing in formal settings.*

### Potential Curse (If DM wants drama)
*The ring bonds so deeply with your companion that if it dies while you wear the ring, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion from psychic feedback.*
