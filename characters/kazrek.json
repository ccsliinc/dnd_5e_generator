His hands bear the calluses of a smith, though they now crackle with arcane energy. His deep amber eyes seem to glow faintly when he casts spells, a sign of the wild magic that awakened within him during his years of solitary study in the mountains.",

  "backstory": "Kazrek spent decades as a master smith in the Ironpeak Mountains, renowned for his ability to forge weapons of exceptional quality. But something changed when he discovered an ancient vein of crystal deep in an abandoned mine - crystals that hummed with magical energy.\n\nThe crystals awakened something dormant within him. Wild magic began to manifest unbidden, causing his forge fires to burn in strange colors and his hammered steel to sing. Frightened by these powers he couldn't control, Kazrek retreated into hermitage, spending years studying the crystals and learning to channel the sorcerous power that now flowed through him.\n\nNow he emerges from seclusion, his smith's pragmatism tempered by arcane knowledge, seeking to understand the true nature of his gift and the mysterious crystals that awakened it.",
