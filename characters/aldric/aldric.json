His face bears the weathered look of someone who has seen battle, with a thin scar across his left cheek. He keeps his brown hair cropped short in military fashion, and his blue eyes hold a steady, determined gaze.\n\nHis chain mail is well-maintained but shows signs of heavy use, and he carries himself with the quiet confidence of an experienced warrior.",

  "backstory": "Born to a farming family in the borderlands, Aldric enlisted in the local militia at sixteen after his village was raided by bandits. His natural aptitude for combat and unwavering courage quickly earned him recognition, and he rose through the ranks to become a sergeant.\n\nDuring a border skirmish three years ago, Aldric led a patrol into an ambush. Though he fought valiantly and saved several of his men, the battle cost the lives of half his squad. The weight of those deaths haunts him still.\n\nSeeking redemption and purpose, Aldric left the military and turned to adventuring. He hopes that by protecting the innocent and fighting evil, he can honor the memory of those who fell under his command.",
