  "backstory": "Born to a farming family in the borderlands, Aldric enlisted in the local militia at sixteen after his village was raided by bandits. His natural aptitude for combat and unwavering courage quickly earned him recognition, and he rose through the ranks to become a sergeant.\n\nDuring a border skirmish three years ago, Aldric led a patrol into an ambush. Though he fought valiantly and saved several of his men, the battle cost the lives of half his squad. The weight of those deaths haunts him still.\n\nSeeking redemption and purpose, Aldric left the military and turned to adventuring. He hopes that by protecting the innocent and fighting evil, he can honor the memory of those who fell under his command.",
