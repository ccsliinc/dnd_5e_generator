During the attack, he discovered a wounded bear cub whose mother had been slain by the orcs. Together, they fought off the raiders. Thorek wielded his grandfather's warhammer while the young bear battled with surprising ferocity.\n\nThe village elder proclaimed them both heroes, and from that day forward, Thorek and the bear became inseparable companions. He named the bear Ironjaw for his powerful bite, and now they travel the land together as defenders of the common folk.",
