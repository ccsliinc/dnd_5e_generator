Thorek wielded his grandfather's warhammer while the young bear battled with surprising ferocity.\n\nThe village elder proclaimed them both heroes, and from that day forward, Thorek and the bear became inseparable companions. He named the bear Ironjaw for his powerful bite, and now they travel the land together as defenders of the common folk.",

When worn by a Beast Master, the etchings emit a faint green luminescence, and the ranger's animal companion's eyes occasionally gleam with the same emerald light. The ring feels warm to the touch when beasts are near, and observers swear the carved vines slowly shift when viewed from the corner of one's eye."
