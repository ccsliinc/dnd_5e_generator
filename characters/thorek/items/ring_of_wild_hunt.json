When worn by a Beast Master, the etchings emit a faint green luminescence, and the ranger's animal companion's eyes occasionally gleam with the same emerald light. The ring feels warm to the touch when beasts are near, and observers swear the carved vines slowly shift when viewed from the corner of one's eye."
