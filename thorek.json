  "backstory": "Thorek was a simple woodsman living on the edge of the great forest, making his living as a carpenter and guide. One fateful autumn, an orc warband descended upon his village. During the attack, he discovered a wounded bear cub whose mother had been slain by the orcs. Together, they fought off the raiders. Thorek wielded his grandfather's warhammer while the young bear battled with surprising ferocity.\n\nThe village elder proclaimed them both heroes, and from that day forward, Thorek and the bear became inseparable companions. He named the bear Ironjaw for his powerful bite, and now they travel the land together as defenders of the common folk.",
