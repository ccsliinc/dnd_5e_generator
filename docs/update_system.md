# WEEKLY D&D SHEET UPDATE SYSTEM

## How to Use This System

**Before Each Session:**
1. Print current character sheet (Kazrek_Spellforge_Level2.md)
2. Take session tracker page for notes during play

**After Each Session:**
1. Come back here and tell me:
   - XP gained
   - New loot/equipment
   - Story events
   - Spells used
   - Any level ups or changes

2. I'll update both files and create fresh printable versions

## Quick Update Checklist

### Information I Need Each Week:
- [ ] Session number and date
- [ ] XP gained this session
- [ ] New treasure/equipment/coins
- [ ] Major story events (1-2 sentences)
- [ ] Any character changes (level up, new spells, etc.)
- [ ] Damage taken (if carrying over)

### What I'll Update:
- [ ] Current HP and resources
- [ ] Total XP and level progression
- [ ] Equipment list and currency
- [ ] Session tracker log
- [ ] Any new abilities/spells from level ups

## Level Up Procedures

### When You Hit 900 XP (Level 3):
1. Roll or take average HP: 1d6+4 (or 8)
2. Choose 2 Metamagic options
3. Learn 1 new 1st level spell
4. Gain 2nd level spell slots (2 slots)
5. Update Sorcery Points to 3

### Common Level 3 Choices:
**Metamagic:** Subtle Spell + Twinned Spell  
**New Spell:** Misty Step, Web, or Mirror Image  

## Emergency Fixes

If something's wrong with your sheet during play:
- **HP Calculation:** Level 2 = 6+4+6+4 = 20 max HP
- **Spell Save DC:** 8 + 2 (Cha) + 2 (Prof) = 12
- **Spell Attack:** 2 (Cha) + 2 (Prof) = +4
- **AC without armor:** 10 + 1 (Dex) = 11

1. **Kazrek_Spellforge_Level2.md** - Current character sheet
